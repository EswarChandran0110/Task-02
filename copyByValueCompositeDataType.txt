*copy by value a composite datatype:
                 ->Every array or object is copied by reference in JS, but they can also be
copied by value on the application of SPREAD OPERATOR(...).what spread operator will do is it 
will separate an array elements to individual elements and again it will arrange the individual
elements into an array assiged to a variable.in that way the two variables will be pointing to
two diff arrays or objects.
eg)
              var array1=[1,2,3];
              var array2=[...array1]; 
              array2.push(2);
              console.log(array1) //prints [1,2,3]
              console.log(array2) //prints [1,2,3,2]
