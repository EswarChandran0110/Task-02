*copy by reference:
     ->Objects in JS are stored and copied by reference,ie) whenever an object is assigned 
to a variable , the variable does not copies or stores the object itself instead the 
address of the memory which holds the object is assigned to the variable.also for an object
to be equal to another object, the another object should be the same object;ie)the variables
which being compared to be equal should point the same object.there can be multiples of
variables which points to the same object.copying the objects means copying the address of
the memory location of the object shortly known as reference.
eg)
                var a=[1,2,3];
                var b=a;
                console.log(a); //prints [1,2,3]
                b.push(4);
                console.log(a); //prints [1,2,3,4]
                console.log(b); //prints [1,2,3,4]

*copy by value:
      ->Primitive data types can be stored and copied by value,ie) the primitive values
which are assigned to a variables are stored in the variables, which can be accessed as a 
whole value through the variables itself.whenever two variables are compared for equality
the variables should contain the same value to be consider as a equal. while copying the
primitive values, the values are copied on the whole. hence the name copy by value. 
eg) 
                var a1=5;
                var b1=a;
                b1=10;
                console.log(a1); //prints 5
                console.log(b1); //prints 10
